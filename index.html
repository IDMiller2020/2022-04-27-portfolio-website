            Hello, welcome to my portfolio website.
          </p>
          <p>My most recent work experience includes 10 1/2 years as a Project Manager in the Building Automation Industry. I was initially hired by Siemens Industry in the state of Alaska as an Engineering Specialist. In this position I was working on small projects where I was responsible for system engineering, system programming and startup, and running the projects from start to finish. After gaining experience in these areas, I moved into a Project Manger role where I was eventually given responsibility for managing my companies projects for the two largest hospital campuses in Alaska.</p>
          <p>In 2019, my wife and I decided to move our family from Alaska to Idaho. About a year after moving to Idaho, I decided to pursue a career in Software Development and enrolled in the Spring 2021 CodeWorks Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp.
          which I recently completed, and I am now
            looking for job opportunities using my Software Development skills.</p>
          <p>In my previous work as a Project Manager, I was often recognized for building good working
            relationships with customers and coworkers. Because of this, I am particularly proud of the fact that as
            a project manager I was often given responsibility for projects with our most demanding and challenging
            customers.</p>
          <p>As I switch over to pursuing a career in Software Development, I am confident that my years of
            experience building good relationships, while managing technically complex Building Automation projects,
            along with my Full Stack Software Development skills, will make me a good addition to any company that
            is looking for software developer who will be a good team player and help strengthen relationships with
            customers.</p>
          <!-- <p>As a software developer, I am excited continue learning new things and polish my software development
            skills. As I gain more experience and become a senior developer, I would love to have the opportunity to
            instruct and mentor new software developers and teach them to create clean, intuitive, efficiently
            written code that makes users say, “wow, I love it, it works great!”</p> -->
          <p>Thanks for giving me the chance to introduce myself. I hope you will continue look around my
            portfolio website. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills. My contact info is included below and I would love to hear from you if you have any software development job opportunities for me to check out.</p>
