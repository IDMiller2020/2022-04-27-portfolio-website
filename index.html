          Hello, welcome to my portfolio website.
        </p>
        <p>My previous work experience includes 10 1/2 years as a Project Manager in the building Automation
          Industry. I started out as an Engineering Specialist working on small projects where I was responsible
          for system engineering, system programming and startup, and running the projects from start to finish.
          As I gained more experience, I moved into a Project Manger role where I was given responsibility for
          managing my companies projects for the two largest hospital campuses in Alaska.</p>
        <p>About a year after moving to Idaho, I decided to pursue a career in Software Development and enrolled
          in the CodeWorks Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp, which I recently completed, and I am now
          looking for job opportunities using my Software Development skills.</p>
        <p>In my previous work as a Project Manager, I was often recognized for building good working
          relationships with customers and coworkers. Because of this, I am particularly proud of the fact that as
          a project manager I was often given responsibility for projects with our most demanding and challenging
          customers.</p>
        <p>As I switch over to pursuing a career in Software Development, I am confident that my years of
          experience building good relationships, while managing technically complex Building Automation projects,
          along with my Full Stack Software Development skills, will make me a good addition to any company that
          is looking for software developer who will be a good team player and help strengthen relationships with
          customers.</p>
        <!-- <p>As a software developer, I am excited continue learning new things and polish my software development
          skills. As I gain more experience and become a senior developer, I would love to have the opportunity to
          instruct and mentor new software developers and teach them to create clean, intuitive, efficiently
          written code that makes users say, “wow, I love it, it works great!”</p> -->
        <p>Thanks for giving me the chance to introduce myself. I hope you will continue look around my
          portfolio website. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills. My contact info is included below and I’d love to hear from you if you have any software development job opportunities for me to check out.</p>
