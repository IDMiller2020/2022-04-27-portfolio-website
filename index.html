            Hello, welcome to my portfolio website.
          </p>
          <p>My most recent work experience includes 10 1/2 years as a Project Manager in the Building Automation Industry. I was initially hired by Siemens Industry in the state of Alaska as an Engineering Specialist. In this position I was working on small projects where I was responsible for system engineering, system programming and startup, and running the projects from start to finish. After gaining experience in these areas, I moved into a Project Manger role where I was eventually given responsibility for managing my companies projects for the two largest hospital campuses in Alaska.</p>
          <p>In 2019, my wife and I decided to move our family from Alaska to Idaho, and about a year after moving to Idaho, I decided to pursue a career in Software Development. At that time, I enrolled in the Spring 2021 CodeWorks Full Stack Software Development bootcamp. Since successfully completing the CodeWork bootcamp, I have continued to work on developing my programming skills and gaining a deeper understanding of software development.</p>
          <p>As I continue to pursue a career in Software Development, I am confident that my years of experience building good relationships, while managing technically complex Building Automation projects, along with my Full Stack Software Development skills, will make me a good addition to any company that is looking for a software developer who will be a good team player and help strengthen relationships with customers.</p>
          <p>Thanks for giving me the chance to introduce myself. I hope you will continue look around my portfolio website. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills. My contact info is included below and I would love to hear from you if you have any software development job opportunities for me to check out.</p>
