Previous portfolio website used a Bootstrap template.  I would like to copy the same look and functionality without the template using HTML, CSS, CSS Grid, and JavaScript.
Basic Sections:
Banner with blue laptop background picture with Name and Title on top of the background picture
Navbar below the banner.  The nav bar should scroll to the top of the page then stick there.
About me section with picture.
Skills Section
Resume Section
Software Developer Portfolio Section (at least three websites/apps)
Contact section
Inter page links with smooth scroll to each section
links to detail pages for each portfolio website/app
links to actual websites/apps.
Webpage will be responsive for varying screen sizes.
Follow website accessability best practices.
At least one interactive JavaScript item (smooth scroll, drop down menu, show/hide content, other ideas).
Deploy site on GitHub Pages using custom domain name.
